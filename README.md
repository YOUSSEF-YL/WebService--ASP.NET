ASP.NET Mini Weather WebService
This is a simple ASP.NET WebService that provides basic weather information for a given location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and exposes a REST API that returns JSON responses.

Requirements
To run this WebService, you'll need the following:

Visual Studio 2019 or later
.NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
An OpenWeatherMap API key
Installation
Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a local folder.
Open the solution file (MiniWeatherWebService.sln) in Visual Studio.
Replace the placeholder API key in the Web.config file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.

Start the WebService by running the project (F5).
Usage
The WebService exposes a single endpoint (/weather/{location}) that accepts a location parameter and returns weather data for that location in JSON format.

To test the WebService, you can use a tool like Postman or cURL:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:port/weather/New%20York
Replace port with the actual port number used by the WebService.

The response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

Location: the name of the requested location.
Temperature: the current temperature in Celsius.
Description: a brief description of the weather conditions (e.g. "clear sky", "light rain").
